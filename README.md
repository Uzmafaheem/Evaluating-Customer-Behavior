# Retail Customer Behavior & Promotional Impact Analysis
üìå Project Overview

The analysis focuses on three store locations‚ÄîCity Center, Suburb, and Rural‚Äîand addresses two key business questions:

Do customer spending patterns, satisfaction levels, and product preferences differ across store locations?

Do promotional periods result in significantly higher spending compared to non-promotional periods?

By completing this project, I practiced:

Designing and executing statistical analyses in a real-world scenario.

Reinforcing understanding of test selection, assumptions, and interpretation.

Translating statistical insights into business recommendations.

üõí Business Scenario

You are tasked with providing insights that will guide decision-making in:

Inventory management

Staffing strategies

Customer experience improvements

Promotional ROI evaluation

üìä Business Metrics & Minimum Detectable Effects (MDEs)
1. Spending Across Locations

Business-relevant MDE: ‚â• $10 relative difference in average spending.

Justification: A difference of $10+ is meaningful enough to adjust location-specific strategies such as inventory stocking and staff allocation.

2. Ratings Across Locations

Business-relevant MDE: ‚â• 1.0 point difference on a 10-point satisfaction scale.

Justification: A one-point difference is noticeable and actionable, signaling potential improvements in customer service quality.

3. Promotional Spending

Business-relevant MDE: ‚â• $15 increase during promotional periods.

Justification: Promotions reduce margins by ~15‚Äì20%. To be cost-effective, spending must rise by at least 25%. This aligns with industry standards for promotional ROI.

‚öôÔ∏è Methods & Tools

The analysis applies statistical techniques and data science workflows, including:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Hypothesis Testing (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square as appropriate)

Confidence Intervals for effect size estimation

Visualization of spending, ratings, and promotional impact

Tools & Libraries:

Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

‚úÖ Expected Outcomes

The project delivers:

Evidence on whether customer behavior differs across locations.

Insights on whether promotions drive enough incremental spending to justify their cost.

Recommendations for retail strategy adjustments (e.g., targeted promotions, staffing, product mix).
